<!--

The player bar also has play and pause buttons that should show/hide under certain conditions.
Determine what you should show and when you should show it.
Create a markdown table (like the one presented in this checkpoint) to hold this information and send it to your mentor.

So my initial thought is that we want the play and pause buttons to show when nothing is playing,
and then we want to hide the appropriate button once we hit play or pause, i.e. if a song is playing,
then we hide the play button, once we stop the song, unhide the play button. Once you hit the play
button again, hide it. Now for the hard part...

<td class="play-pause-buttons">
     <button ng-show="!playing && !paused">Play</span>
     <a class="play-button"><span class="ion-play"></span></a>

     <button ng-show="!paused">Pause</span>
     <a class="pause-button"><span class="ion-pause"></span></a>
 </td>
